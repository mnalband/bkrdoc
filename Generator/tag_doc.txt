#@ indicates start of line which will be exported to documentation
after #@ we can make tags by adding "@" at the start of the tag name.

example:
    #@ @action Test if actualy value in arg is not "enabled" and @important "disabled"
result:
    action: Test if actualy value in arg is not "enabled" and
    important: "disabled"

If you type #@ and immediately on the new line # will make block comment

example:
    # @ Print help informations
    # Using of block comment
    # This could be usefull

result:
    Print help informations
    Using of block comment
    This could be usefull

If you type #@ before begginig of condition, loop, function or phase. It will make 
description of this part of code.
